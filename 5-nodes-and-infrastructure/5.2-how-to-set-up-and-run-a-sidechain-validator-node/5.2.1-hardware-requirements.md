# 5.2.1 Hardware Requirements

SGX will be deprecated on user hardware, which means that you need server hardware to run SGX.  There are many possible options, but we can suggest a `Dell PowerEdge R340 Server`, where the CPU **must be** an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2276G CPU @ 3.80 GHz.



**Enable SGX Support in the BIOS**

Enter the Dell BIOS, go to `System Security,` and set the following values:

* `Intel SGX=on`
* `SGX Launch Control Policy=Unlocked`
