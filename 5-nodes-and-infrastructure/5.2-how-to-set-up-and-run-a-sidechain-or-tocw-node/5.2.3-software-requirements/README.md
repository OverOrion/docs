# 5.2.3 Software requirements

In short, you need to install the following components to start developing and compiling the code:

* [Intel SGX driver](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver), [SGX, and PSW](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Rust SGX SDK](https://github.com/apache/incubator-teaclave-sgx-sdk)
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

However, we strongly recommend either using Ansible or Docker to set up the environment.
