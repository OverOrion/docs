# 5.3.1 Why deploy on Integritee Network

Regardless of your product of choice, you’d probably want to deploy it on the Integritee network. The Integritee Network serves as the public registry of remotely attested enclaves, which your clients can consult to verify that you have a bullet-proof setup and are not tampering with your servers. Of course, you don’t need to do that, but then your customers need to verify themselves the certificate and proof of Intel, i.e, the remote attestation. Further, to request a remote attestation from Intel, they’d need to register with Intel’s IAS, while with our network, it boils down to a single web request.

So why not use another blockchain? First, most of the blockchains lack the crypto primitives to verify such certificates, like the EVM. Second, we will offer stable USD transaction fees, which means that your operational costs are perfectly predictable, a requirement for an industrial business case in our opinion. Moreover, deploying on Integritee allows you to leverage the trust Integritee Network builds as a reliable registry of trusted execution and you save on maintenance of L1 attestation logic and whitelisting
