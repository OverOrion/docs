# 3.5 Use cases

Our frameworks and products (SDK, TEEracle, Attesteer) serve a broad range of use cases. Our SDK can be used to develop any blockchain-based solution in need for speed, confidentiality and scalability. The TEEracle framework is equally flexible and can retrieve data for basically any smart contract application. Attesteer provides verifiable computation and privacy for all users of TEE technology - totally independent of the application or data processed within the TEE. Below, we listed only some of the typical use cases that we have seen evolving over the past months.
