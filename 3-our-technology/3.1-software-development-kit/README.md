# 3.1 Software Development Kit

With our SDK, we give everyone the opportunity to use our technology exactly in the way you want. With the very liberal Apache2 license, you are free to develop, distribute and deploy your product any way you see fit.

### Substrate Runtime Compatibility

Have you already developed substrate pallets for your (para-)chain but now want to add confidentiality and scalability?

The Integritee SDK is compatible with substrate runtime pallets. With a few lines of glue-code you can reuse your pallets and instantiate them inside an Integritee off-chain worker or sidechain. It is even possible to trustlessly interact between on- and off-chain runtimes
