# 2.7.4. Intel SGX

Intel’s SGX is a specific TEE technology developed by Intel. It comes in the form of hardware-based encryption that is built-in to [many Intel processors](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/search/featurefilter.html?productType=873) released in the last years. It enables system memory to be split into so-called enclaves — private, hardware-encrypted areas within RAM. Enclaves operate a bit like a secret vault, where applications can process sensitive data without the risk of it being exposed.
