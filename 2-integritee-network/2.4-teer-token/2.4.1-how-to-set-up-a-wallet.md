# 2.4.1 How to Set Up a Wallet

There are different ways to set up a wallet, but we recommend doing so through polkadot{.js}. From there follow the following steps: Set up your Polkadot-js browser extension, manage accounts for substrate-based chains for either chrome or Firefox.

Create a new account and make sure you back up the seed phrase securely and protect the account with a strong password.

Then, select Integritee Network from the drop-down list.

If you are looking for Integritee, remember to visit the Integritee Parachain on the Polkadot/Substrate Portal and click Settings → Metadata → Update Metadata to make sure the metadata for your extension is up to date. Integritee uses the Substrate-based chain address format SS58.

Integritee Network addresses start with the number 2. Polkadot addresses always start with the number 1. Kusama addresses always start with a capital letter like C, D, F, G, H, J, etc. Generic Substrate addresses start with 5.
