# 2.5.2 Technical Committee

The Technical Committee (TC) consists of technical experts with a lot of knowledge about the Integritee architecture. Members are added or removed from the TC via a simple majority vote of the Council.

The purpose of the TC is to safeguard against malicious referenda, implement bug fixes, reverse faulty runtime updates, or add new but battle-tested features. The TC has the power to fast-track proposals by using the Democracy pallet and is the only origin that can trigger the fast-tracking functionality. We can consider the TC to be a "unique origin" that cannot generate proposals, but can fast-track existing proposals.

Fast-tracked referenda are the only type of referenda that can be active alongside another active referendum. Thus, with fast-tracked referenda, it is possible to have two active referenda at the same time. Voting on one does not prevent a user from voting on the other.
