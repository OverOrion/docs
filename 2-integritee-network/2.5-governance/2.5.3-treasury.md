# 2.5.3 Treasury

Fees are collected in an on-chain treasury. Treasury funds are used for ongoing maintenance and operation of the parachainâ€™s infrastructure and software, as well as ecosystem development and community activity rewards.

The allocation of treasury funds is delegated to an on-chain council (see Section 7). Service providers can request funds to deliver their services and the council will evaluate proposals and allocate funds at its discretion.
