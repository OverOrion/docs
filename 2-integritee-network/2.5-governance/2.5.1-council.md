# 2.5.1 Council

The Integritee Council is responsible for the parachain’s control. The TEER token allows its holders to vote for individuals or entities seeking election to the council.

The TEER token will soon freely float among multiple parachains. Thus, governance — which relies on coin voting — should also be unified. Therefore, a single elected council and all acts involving coin voting will be aggregated across all parachains/parathreads. Service providers can request funds to deliver their services and the council will evaluate proposals and allocate funds at its discretion.

The TEER token allows its holders to vote for individuals or entities seeking election to the council. This means that every token holder will have the power to drive the future development of the platform and the future of privacy-preserving apps and ecosystems.
