# 2.8 History

Integritee is a Zurich-based startup that was founded in 2021 by Alain Brenzikofer and Waldemar Scherer. However, the technical work on the project started in 2018. As of now, we plan to execute and deliver on our roadmap for this year. If you see our planned roadmap for 2021, you can see weâ€™ve delivered on everything we said we would in a very short period of time. We will be focusing on a Polkadot parachain slot and on becoming the leading privacy solution in the Polkadot/Kusama space.
