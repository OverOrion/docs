# 2.2.4 Crowdloan

Crowdloans follow the same logic as crowdfundings. The “crowd” – communities, members, fans, supporters, etc – contribute to a specific project or cause. However, there’s a big difference between both concepts: in crowdfundings, the money goes for the project and doesn’t return to the investors, whereas crowdloans have a bonding logic, where the money contributors invested is later returned to them, and most of the time with rewards included.

In Integritee’s case, once the 96-week lease period has elapsed, all supporters will regain access to their DOT, but still get to keep any TEER rewards they have received. In addition, it is important to note that the DOT is simply locked for the duration of the lease, so crowdloan backers never lose ownership of their tokens during the entire process.
