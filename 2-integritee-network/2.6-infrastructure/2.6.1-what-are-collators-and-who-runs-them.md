# 2.6.1 What are Collators and who runs them?

Collators produce parachain blocks and send them together with a proof-of-validity (PoV) to Relay Chain validators for validation and finalization. Collators do not need to be trusted because the security of parachains comes from the Relay Chain validators.

Collators are, however, necessary for availability. The Integritee parachain will not incentivize collators through its token. Instead, it relies on the assumption that whoever runs TEEs on Integritee already has ample incentive to ensure that an adequate number of collators are running.
