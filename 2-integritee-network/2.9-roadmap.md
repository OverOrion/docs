# 2.9 Roadmap

In 2022’s first quarter, we won a parachain slot on Kusama, which allowed us to greatly develop our project and initiate a series of collaborations and deployments. Within the same period, Integritee was named 1 of 10 ‘super’ promising startups in Switzerland in 2022 by EU-Startups.

In Q2, we migrated to the Kusama parachain, which meant the start of something new and exciting. We reached the finals of Eurobits, ESCO Startup Award 2022, and were able to release the Sidechain SDK and the TEEracle.

Token-wise, there were also some achievements as [TEER got listed on the top-tier exchange Kraken](https://medium.com/integritee/june-milestones-kraken-listing-talking-at-polkadot-decoded-more-fc85e3e6ca79). You can now find, buy and sell it. Our tech team was also busy, having successfully completed [XCM integrations](https://medium.com/integritee/xcm-integration-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work-37e81cdc74e2) with two other blockchain projects: [Moonbeam](https://medium.com/integritee/xcm-integration-of-integritee-and-moonriver-is-completed-xcteer-is-now-live-and-available-on-9a0bde399911) and [Acala](https://medium.com/integritee/cross-chain-integration-of-integritee-and-karura-is-complete-teer-now-live-on-karura-9775c2e95366).

The third quarter is marked by the release of the Securitee platform product on the OVHcloud marketplace, as well as by the release of the Attesteer. 2022’s Q3 also marks yet another milestone: winning a parachain slot on Polkadot, thus fostering new tools for breaking ground.\
\
During the last quarter, the launch of our Polkadot parachain and the onboarding of more Integritee sidechain projects are some of our key goals to grow the ecosystem.\
