# 2.1.2 Why not just use the Intel Attestation Service (IAS)?

Remote users can request a remote attestation of the Intel Attestation Service (IAS). It enables them to interface with a TEE from a remote system, while having confidence that the application has not been tampered with and is running on a genuine TEE. However, to request a remote attestation, the user must be registered with IAS.

Integritee democratizes access to the technology by enabling firms to leverage remotely attested TEEs without needing their clients to individually register with the IAS. This greatly increasing practicability, and therefore lowers the border for adoption without compromising security. Blockchain developers and firms can create dapps with Integritee that process potentially sensitive data off-chain in a highly secure way.
